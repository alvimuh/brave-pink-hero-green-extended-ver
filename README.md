# Welcome to Brave Pink Hero Green (Extended)

## Objective

- Brave Pink + Hero Green, which became one of the elements of the 17+8 People’s Demands campaign towards the Indonesian Parliament (DPR).
- There was controversy protesting the use of the pink color, which gave me the idea: what if I created a similar website but with customizable color tones according to the user’s preference.
- I think the campaign itself was very good — using non-harmful and creative methods — but once again, it ended up causing division among Indonesians.
- In the end, I decided not to publish the website to avoid sparking new conflict.
- Instead, I only published the source code as a technical learning resource for developers.
